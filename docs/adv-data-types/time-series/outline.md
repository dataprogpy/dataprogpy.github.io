Choice B

Your high-level plan for introducing time series analysis is structurally sound and aligns well with the course objectives. It correctly aims to leverage students' existing knowledge of Polars and Altair while introducing necessary new concepts and specialized tools like `statsmodels`.

Here is an evaluation of your plan, identification of potential gaps, and a detailed content outline suitable for both a three-hour lecture and an independent learning module for working professionals.

## **Evaluation of High-Level Plan**

### **Strengths**

* **Continuity of Tools:** Relying on Polars and Altair for initial wrangling and visualization maintains consistency with previous modules.  
* **Conceptual Grounding:** Starting by contrasting time series analysis with traditional machine learning workflows is crucial for students accustomed to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data.  
* **Appropriate Datasets:** Using classic datasets like Air Passengers or Sunspots provides clear examples of trend and seasonality.  
* **Introduction of Specialized Libraries:** Introducing `statsmodels` is essential for standard time series modeling and decomposition.

### **Potential Gaps and Recommendations**

1. **Managing Scope and Complexity:**  
   * **Gap:** Your plan includes ARIMA, GARCH, and Fourier transforms. Introducing all these in a single introductory lesson is overly ambitious, especially for beginners. GARCH (for modeling volatility) and Fourier transforms (for frequency domain analysis) are mathematically intensive and likely beyond the scope of an "essentials" course.  
   * **Recommendation:** Focus on building intuition for time series decomposition, exponential smoothing, and a conceptual introduction to ARIMA. De-prioritize GARCH and Fourier transforms, perhaps mentioning them as advanced topics.  
2. **Time Series Cross-Validation:**  
   * **Gap:** While you plan to contrast workflows, the most critical difference in modeling—how validation is performed—needs explicit focus. Students must understand why random K-Fold CV (which they learned previously) is inappropriate for time series due to temporal leakage.  
   * **Recommendation:** Dedicate a specific section to time-dependent validation techniques, such as train-test splits based on time and rolling cross-validation (e.g., `TimeSeriesSplit` in scikit-learn, although `statsmodels` requires manual implementation).  
3. **Specific Polars Time Series Functionality:**  
   * **Gap:** The plan mentions using Polars for wrangling, but specific time series operations need emphasis.  
   * **Recommendation:** Explicitly cover Polars' capabilities for datetime manipulation, resampling (upsampling and downsampling), calculating lags, and computing rolling/expanding window statistics.  
4. **Baseline Modeling:**  
   * **Gap:** Jumping straight to complex models like ARIMA can be daunting.  
   * **Recommendation:** Introduce naive forecasting methods (e.g., persistence, seasonal naive) first. These provide essential benchmarks that any sophisticated model must outperform.

## **Detailed Content Outline: Introduction to Time Series Analysis**

This outline is structured for modular delivery, suitable for a static site and a lecture flow.

### **Module 1: Understanding Time Series Data**

This module introduces the fundamental characteristics of time series data and how it differs from the cross-sectional data analyzed in previous modules.

* **1.1 What is Time Series Data?**  
  * Definition: Data indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order.  
  * The crucial role of temporal dependency.  
* **1.2 Time Series vs. Traditional Machine Learning:**  
  * **Traditional ML:** Assumes data points are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Random sampling and K-Fold CV are standard.  
  * **Time Series:** Observations are dependent; the order matters. The goal is often **forecasting** (predicting future values) rather than just prediction.  
  * Why standard cross-validation fails (data leakage from the future).  
* **1.3 Components of a Time Series:**  
  * **Trend:** Long-term increase or decrease in the data.  
  * **Seasonality:** Regular, repeating patterns or cycles (e.g., weekly, yearly).  
  * **Cyclicity:** Rises and falls that are not of a fixed frequency (e.g., economic cycles).  
  * **Noise/Irregularity:** Random variation or residuals.  
* **1.4 Introduction to Stationarity:**  
  * Definition: A time series whose statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation) do not change over time.  
  * Why it matters: Many classical models (like ARIMA) require stationary data.  
  * Visualizing non-stationary data (using the Air Passengers dataset as an example).

  * **Upsampling:** Moving to a higher frequency and handling resulting missing values (interpolation or filling).  
* **2.3 Feature Engineering: Lags and Windows:**  
  * **Lag Features:** Using previous time steps as input features (`.shift()`). Crucial for capturing autocorrelation.  
  * **Rolling Windows (Moving Averages):** Smoothing data and calculating rolling statistics (`.rolling()`).

  * Lag plots to visually inspect autocorrelation.  
* **3.2 Time Series Decomposition (using `statsmodels`):**  
  * Additive vs. Multiplicative models.  
  * Using `seasonal_decompose` to separate Trend, Seasonality, and Residuals.  
  * Introduction to STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) as a robust method.  
* **3.3 Analyzing Autocorrelation:**  
  * **Autocorrelation Function (ACF):** Correlation between the series and its lags. Identifying seasonality and MA components.  
  * **Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF):** Correlation after removing the effects of shorter lags. Identifying AR components.  
  * *Demo:* Generating and interpreting ACF/PACF plots using `statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots`.

* **4.1 Baseline (Naive) Models:**  
  * **Naive Forecast:** Using the last observation as the forecast.  
  * **Seasonal Naive (SNaive):** Using the observation from the last seasonal cycle.  
  * *Importance:* Establishing a benchmark that more complex models must beat.  
* **4.2 Smoothing Methods (using `statsmodels`):**  
  * **Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES):** For data with no clear trend or seasonality.  
  * **Holt’s Linear Trend Method:** Extension of SES for data with a trend.  
  * **Holt-Winters’ Seasonal Method:** Extension for data with trend and seasonality.  
* **4.3 Introduction to ARIMA Models:**  
  * Conceptual overview (avoid deep mathematics).  
  * **AR (Autoregression):** Dependence on previous observations.  
  * **I (Integrated):** Differencing the series to achieve stationarity.  
  * **MA (Moving Average):** Dependence on past forecast errors.  
  * *Demo:* Fitting a basic ARIMA model using `statsmodels.tsa.arima.model.ARIMA`.

### **Module 5: Time Series Model Evaluation**

This module addresses how to properly validate and evaluate forecasts, respecting the temporal structure of the data.

* **5.1 Time-Based Train-Test Splitting:**  
  * Why we must split sequentially (training on the past, testing on the future).  
  * Visualization of a simple chronological split.  
* **5.2 Time Series Cross-Validation (Rolling Forecast):**  
  * Introduction to "walk-forward validation" or rolling origin forecasting.  
  * Visualizing how the training window expands or slides. (Can mention `TimeSeriesSplit` from scikit-learn if using ML models for forecasting, but focus on the concept).  
* **5.3 Forecasting Metrics:**  
  * Evaluating forecast accuracy:  
    * **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)  
    * **MSE** (Mean Squared Error) and **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)  
    * **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) – useful for business context but has limitations.  
* **5.4 Model Diagnostics and Residual Analysis:**  
  * Checking if residuals resemble white noise (no autocorrelation, zero mean, constant variance).  
  * Visualizing residual ACF plots.

Of course. Here's an evaluation of your high-level plan for the time series analysis lesson in your "Data Programming Essentials with Python" course, along with identified gaps and a detailed content outline.

Your plan is solid and covers the essential components of an introductory time series lesson. The emphasis on comparing workflows with traditional machine learning is an excellent starting point for students who have already been introduced to `scikit-learn`. The selection of Python libraries is appropriate and aligns with the rest of your course.

### **Gaps in Your High-Level Plan**

While your outline is a great start, here are a few areas where it could be strengthened, particularly for working professionals who value detailed, self-paced learning:

* **Conceptual Bridging**: The plan jumps from core concepts to modeling. It would be beneficial to have a more explicit bridge that explains *why* a given time series property (like a trend or seasonality) necessitates a specific modeling approach.  
* **Feature Engineering**: Explicitly dedicating a section to time-based feature engineering would be highly beneficial. This is a common practice and a natural extension of the data wrangling your students have already learned.  
* **Model Validation Strategy**: The plan mentions model evaluation, but it's crucial to differentiate time series cross-validation techniques (like forward-chaining or rolling-origin validation) from the standard k-fold cross-validation your students learned with `scikit-learn`.  
* **Forecasting Horizon**: The concept of a forecasting horizon and its impact on model selection and evaluation is an important practical consideration that is not explicitly mentioned.
