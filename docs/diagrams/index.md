The mind is that which thinks, feels, perceives, imagines, remembers, and wills, including both conscious and unconscious processes. Its exact nature is debated, like whether mental phenomena are internal activities of transforming information or dispositions to engage in observable behavior. The mind–body problem is the challenge of explaining the relation between matter and mind. According to physicalism, minds are not independent entities but certain aspects of material objects. The evolutionary history of the mind is tied to the development of brains, but it is controversial at which point minds emerged and which non-human animals possess minds. Similar theoretical challenges concern the possibility of artificial minds powered by computers. The main fields studying the mind include psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, and the philosophy of mind. Their methods range from empirical observation and neuroimaging to conceptual analysis and thought experiments.
