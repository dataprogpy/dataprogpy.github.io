# **The Colab Interface: Your Workspace**

Now that you have a fresh notebook open, let's get familiar with the main areas you'll be interacting with. Don't feel you need to memorize everything at once – we'll focus on the parts you'll use most often.

## **Interface Overview**

Take a look at your Colab screen. Here are the main parts:

![Colab user interface with annotation](/assets/images/colab_ui_annotated.png)

* *:material-alpha-a-circle:{ .annotation } `Menu Bar` (Top: File, Edit, View, Insert, Runtime, Tools, Help - Standard menu options)*
* *:material-alpha-b-circle:{ .annotation } `Toolbar` (Below Menu: Buttons for common actions like +Code, +Text, file operations, runtime status)*
* *:material-alpha-c-circle:{ .annotation } `Main Cell Area` (The large central area: This is where you'll write and run your code and text)*
* *:material-alpha-d-circle:{ .annotation } `Left Sidebar` (Contains tabs for: Table of Contents, Find/Replace, Code Snippets, Secrets, and importantly, the File Browser)*
* *:material-alpha-e-circle:{ .annotation } `Notebook Title` (Top Left: Where you renamed your notebook)*
* *:material-alpha-f-circle:{ .annotation } `Share Button` (Top Right: For sharing your notebook with others)*
* *:material-alpha-g-circle:{ .annotation } `Runtime Status / Connect Button` (Top Right near Share: Shows if you're connected to a runtime and resource usage)*

You'll spend most of your time writing in the **Main Cell Area (C)**, using the **Toolbar (B)** and **Menu Bar (A)** for actions, and the **Left Sidebar (D)** for navigation and file management.

## **Cells: The Building Blocks**

The core components of any Jupyter-style notebook, including Colab, are **cells**. Think of them as individual containers for your content. There are two primary types:

1.  **Code Cells:**
    * This is where you will write and execute your Python code for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
    * They are usually marked with `[ ]:` brackets to their left. When you run the code in the cell, a number will appear in the brackets (like `[1]:`) indicating the order of execution.
        *(Suggestion: Small screenshot of an empty code cell)*
2.  **Text Cells:**
    * These cells are for writing descriptive text, notes, explanations, section headings, mathematical formulas – essentially, any documentation needed to explain your work.
    * They use a simple formatting syntax called **Markdown**. When you "run" a text cell, Colab renders the Markdown into nicely formatted text (bold, italics, lists, headings, etc.). We'll look closer at Markdown in section 2.5.
        *(Suggestion: Small screenshot of a text cell with some Markdown source, and another showing the rendered output)*

**Switching Between Cell Types:** You can easily change a cell from Code to Text or vice-versa. When a cell is selected (you'll see a border around it), you can use the command pallette  or keyboard shortcuts 

!!! note

    - To invoke commands via keyboard shortcuts, you need to press the ++"prefix"++ combo before the key for the command.
    - The ++"prefix"++ combo in Windows/Linux/ChromeOS is ++ctrl+m++ and in MacOS it is ++cmd+m++
    - To turn a cell into a markdown/text cell press ++"prefix"++then ++m++. 
    - To turn a cell into a code cell press ++"prefix"++ then ++y++. 
    - You can review all keyboard shortcuts available by pressing ++"prefix"++ then ++h++.

## **Running Cells: Bringing Notebooks to Life**

Simply typing in a cell doesn't do anything until you **run** (or **execute**) it. Here are the most common ways to run the currently selected cell:

* ++shift++ + ++enter++ 
    - Executes the current cell and automatically selects the next cell below it. If you're at the last cell, it often creates a new code cell. *Use this to flow through your notebook.*
* ++ctrl++ + ++enter++ on Windows and Linux / ++cmd++ + ++enter++ on MacOS 
    - Executes the current cell but *keeps the focus on the same cell*. Useful if you want to re-run the same code multiple times quickly.
* ++alt++ + ++enter++ / ++opt++ + ++enter++ 
    - Executes the current cell and *inserts a brand new code cell* immediately below it. Handy for adding quick tests or explorations.
* :material-play-circle: Play Icon
    - When you hover your mouse pointer to the left of a *code cell*, a circular 'play' button icon appears. Clicking this runs only that specific cell.
    *(Suggestion: Small screenshot showing the Play icon next to a code cell)*

## **What happens when you run a cell?**

* **Code Cell:** The Python code is executed by the Colab backend (the "Kernel"). Any output generated by the code (e.g., from `print()` statements, calculation results, error messages) will appear directly beneath the cell. The execution counter in the `[ ]:` brackets gets updated.
* **Text Cell:** The Markdown text is rendered into formatted output, making it readable.

**The Cell Toolbar: Quick Actions**

When you select a cell, or sometimes just hover over it, a small toolbar :material-numeric-1-circle:{ .annotation } usually appears (often in the top right corner of the cell). This provides handy shortcuts for common actions:

![Colab cell toolbar](/assets/images/colab_cell_toolbar.png)

Look for icons like:

* Arrows (Up/Down): To move the selected cell up or down in the notebook sequence.
* Trash Can: To delete the current cell (use with caution!).
* Link Icon: To get a direct URL link to that specific cell.
* **✨ Gemini/AI Icons:** Buttons to access integrated AI assistance for generating code, explaining concepts, etc. (More on this in Section 5!).
* Three Dots ('More actions'): Often reveals other options like clearing the output of a cell.

**Get comfortable using this toolbar!** It's often faster than navigating the main menus for these frequent tasks.

## **Staying Organized: Text Cells are Key!**

As your analyses become more involved, your notebooks can get quite long. Effective organization is essential for making them understandable. **Text cells** and **Markdown** are your best friends here.

**Use Markdown for Structure:** Markdown allows you to easily format your text cells. Some essentials:

* `# Heading 1` (Largest heading - use for main titles/sections)
* `## Heading 2` (For sub-sections)
* `### Heading 3` (For smaller points)
* Use `*asterisks*` or `_underscores_` for *italics*.
* Use `**double asterisks**` or `__double underscores__` for **bold text**.
* Start lines with `-` or `*` for bullet points.
* Start lines with `1.`, `2.`, etc., for numbered lists.

!!! note

    Review this [Markdown Guide](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb) from Google for a bite-sized tutorial and a list of references on this topic.

**Leverage the Table of Contents:** Colab automatically creates a navigable Table of Contents based on the Markdown headings in your text cells.

* Find the **Table of Contents icon** (usually looks like three horizontal lines or a bulleted list) in the **Left Sidebar**. Click it.
* A pane will appear showing your headings, nested according to their level (`#`, `##`, etc.).
* **Click any heading in this pane to jump directly to that section** of your notebook. This is incredibly useful for navigation!

**Recommendation:** Make it a habit to use Markdown headings (`#`, `##`) to structure *all* your notebooks (labs, projects). It dramatically improves readability and navigation for yourself and anyone you share your work with.
