### 2. Phase 1: Understanding the Landscape & Defining Goals

Every data story begins with understanding the raw material: your data. But data alone doesn't speak; we need to give it a voice by asking the right questions and defining clear goals for our narrative. This phase is about laying that crucial groundwork.

#### Step 1: The Data Dictionary - Your Starting Point üó∫Ô∏è

Before you can ask meaningful questions of your data, you need to understand what information you have, what each piece of information means, its format, and any potential limitations. This is where the **data dictionary** comes in. It's your map to the dataset.

For this lesson, we'll be working with a dataset containing information about house sales in King County, WA (which includes Seattle). Here's a look at its structure:

**(Imagine this is a nicely formatted table in MkDocs)**

**Why spend time on this?**

* **Identify Key Variables:** Which variables seem most relevant to potential questions about housing? (e.g., `price`, `sqft_liv`, `bedrooms`, `zipcode`, `waterfront`).
* **Understand Data Types:** Knowing if a variable is numerical (integer, float) or categorical (like `zipcode`, even if it looks like a number) is crucial for choosing appropriate analysis and visualization methods. For instance, you might calculate an average `price` (numerical) but you wouldn't average `zipcode`s.
* **Spot Potential Issues:**
    * Are there missing values or placeholder values (like `0` for `yr_renov`) that need special handling?
    * Are there codes or indices (like `view` or `condition`) where you need to understand the scale?
    * Does the `date` field need conversion to a proper date format for time-based analysis? (Hint: Yes, it often does!)
* **Clarify Definitions:** What exactly does `grade` mean? The link provided gives more context. Understanding these nuances is key to accurate storytelling.

**First Look & Familiarization:**

Take a moment to look through this data dictionary.

* What variables immediately catch your eye as potentially interesting for a story about house prices?
* Are there any variables whose meaning isn't immediately obvious?
* What kind of audience might be interested in insights from this data? (e.g., potential homebuyers, sellers, real estate agents, urban planners).

> **üí° Activity: Initial Variable Brainstorm**
>
> Jot down 3-5 variables from this list that you think could be central to understanding housing prices or trends in this area. Consider why each might be important. We'll use this as a starting point for formulating questions.

This covers Step 1. Next, we'll move into Step 2: Articulating Analytical Goals & Research Questions, where we start thinking about what stories this data might tell. How does this look?
