# Review and Validation

You've put in the hard work of planning, exploring, cleaning, visualizing, and narrating. This final phase is about ensuring your efforts culminate in a data story that is clear, accurate, and impactful for your intended audience.

## Step 10: Checking Against Goals âœ…ðŸŽ¯

The primary purpose of this step is to objectively assess your data story against the initial objectives and analytical questions you defined way back in **Step 2**. It's easy to get caught up in the technical details of data wrangling and chart creation, so this is your chance to ensure the final product aligns with your original intent.

**Key Questions for Your Review:**

Ask yourself these questions as you review your sequence of visuals (from Step 8) and the accompanying narrative text and annotations (from Step 9):

1.  **Answers the Analytical Questions?**
    * Go back to the specific analytical questions you drafted in Step 2.
    * Does your data story, as a whole, directly and clearly answer each of these questions?
    * Is the evidence provided in your visuals and text sufficient to support these answers?

2.  **Meets Audience (Persona) Needs?**
    * Revisit the audience persona you created in Step 2.
    * Is the story tailored to their level of understanding, their interests, and their goals?
    * Will *they* find it relevant and valuable?
    * Is the language used appropriate for them?
    * Are the visuals clear and accessible from their perspective?

3.  **Clear Key Message?**
    * What is the single most important message or takeaway you want your audience to get from this data story?
    * Is this message prominent and easy to understand?
    * Do all parts of your story (visuals, text, sequence) work together to support this key message?

4.  **Logical and Coherent Narrative?**
    * Does the story flow logically from one point to the next?
    * Are the transitions between visuals and ideas smooth and easy to follow?
    * Is the "comic strip" (your sequence of visuals) telling a coherent tale, or does it feel disjointed?

5.  **Supported by Data?**
    * Are all claims and interpretations accurately supported by the data presented in your visuals?
    * Have you avoided overstating your findings or drawing conclusions that go beyond what the data can support?
    * Are your visualizations an honest representation of the data?

6.  **Clarity and Conciseness?**
    * Is the story free of jargon that your audience might not understand (unless it's explicitly defined)?
    * Is all the text necessary, or can some be trimmed for brevity without losing meaning?
    * Are the visuals uncluttered and easy to interpret? (This relates back to effective vertical development in Step 7).

**The Goal: Honesty, Constructive Self-Criticism, and the MVP Mindset**

Be honest with yourself during this review. It's better to identify areas for improvement now than for your audience to be confused or unconvinced later. This step might lead you to identify several potential refinements.

However, it's also important to adopt a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** mindset, or in our case, a "Minimum Viable Story." Your primary goal is to ensure your data story effectively answers the core analytical questions for your target audience and delivers the key intended message.

* **Focus on Core Effectiveness First:** Does your story, in its current state, achieve its main purpose? Is it clear, accurate, and does it address the crucial questions? This is your MVP.
* **Prioritize Refinements:** When you identify areas for improvement:
    * Distinguish between "must-have" changes (those essential for clarity, accuracy, or answering the core questions) and "nice-to-have" refinements (e.g., more advanced visual embellishments, deeper dives into secondary questions, stylistic polishing that doesn't alter the core message).
    * Address the "must-haves" to ensure your MVP is solid.
    * List the "nice-to-haves" as potential future iterations. In a professional setting, you often deliver the MVP and then iterate based on feedback or available time.

This approach helps you manage your time effectively and ensures you deliver value even if deadlines are tight. Your review might lead you to:

* **Refine your narrative text (Must-have if unclear):** Clarify explanations, strengthen transitions, or sharpen your key messages to ensure the MVP is effective.
* **Tweak your visuals (Must-have if misleading or confusing):** Make small adjustments to titles, labels, colors, or annotations for better clarity.
* **Re-order visuals (Must-have if flow is illogical):** If the flow is a barrier to understanding the core message, adjust it.
* **Add or remove a visual (Consider for MVP):** If a visual is critical to answering a core question, it's part of the MVP. If it's tangential, it might be a "nice-to-have."
* **(In rare cases) Revisit earlier steps:** If a major flaw *undermines the MVP* (e.g., a critical data error affecting your main conclusion), then addressing it is essential.

This review ensures your data story doesn't just present data, but effectively communicates the intended insights to the intended audience, achieving the purpose you set out to fulfill, starting with a strong, viable core message.

     Take your assembled "mini-story" â€“ the sequence of 2-3 visuals you outlined in Step 8, along with the narrative text and annotation ideas you drafted in Step 9.
    
     1.  **Re-read your analytical questions and persona description** from Step 2. Keep them clearly in mind.
     2.  **Critically review your mini-story** using the "Key Questions for Your Review" listed above.
     3.  **Jot down your honest answers and observations.**
         * What works well?
         * Where are there potential weaknesses or areas for improvement?
     4.  **Prioritize with an MVP Mindset:**
         * Identify the **"must-have" changes** needed for your story to clearly and accurately answer your core analytical questions for your persona (this forms your "Minimum Viable Story").
         * List any **"nice-to-have" refinements** that would enhance the story further but are not critical to its core message.
     5.  Based on your review, list **1-2 specific, actionable "must-have" refinements** you would make to ensure your mini-story is a solid MVP.
    
     This structured self-review, with an eye towards delivering a viable core story, is a vital skill for any data professional.



## Step 11: Final Polish and Presentation Considerations âœ¨

This step is about taking that last look to ensure your data story is presented in the most clear, professional, and effective manner possible. Think of it as the final proofread and visual tidy-up. While major content issues should have been addressed in Step 10, this is where you catch the small things that can make a big difference to the audience's experience.

**Key Areas for Final Polish:**

1.  **Simplicity and Clarity (Revisit "Chart Junk"):**
    * **Edward Tufte's principle of maximizing the "data-ink ratio"** is relevant here: ensure every element on your visuals (ink) is there to convey data information.
    * Remove any unnecessary gridlines, borders, backgrounds, or decorative elements that don't add to understanding (often called "chart junk").
    * Is every visual as simple and direct as it can be while still conveying the necessary information?

2.  **Consistency:**
    * **Formatting:** Are fonts, font sizes, and colors used consistently across your visuals and text?
    * **Terminology:** Are you using the same terms for the same concepts throughout your story?
    * **Visual Style:** Do your charts have a reasonably consistent look and feel (unless variations are intentional for emphasis)? This creates a more professional and cohesive experience.

3.  **Accuracy (Final Double-Check):**
    * **Numbers and Labels:** Quickly verify that all numbers displayed in your charts, tables, or text are accurate. Check axis labels, tick mark values, and any specific data points you've highlighted.
    * **Interpretations:** One last read-through: do your textual interpretations still accurately reflect what the visuals show?

4.  **Proofreading for Typos and Grammar:**
    * Carefully read all titles, captions, narrative text, and annotations for any spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, or awkward phrasing.
    * It can be helpful to read it aloud or ask a colleague to glance over it, as fresh eyes often catch things you might miss.

**Presentation Medium Considerations (e.g., MkDocs):**

How and where your audience will consume your data story can influence some final presentation choices. Since you're preparing content for an MkDocs course site:

* **Layout:** How will your visuals and text be arranged on the page? Will charts be displayed side-by-side (as you might have planned with concatenation in Step 8), or one after another with text in between? Ensure the flow is logical on the webpage.
* **Interactivity:** Altair charts can be interactive (tooltips, zooming, panning). Ensure these features work as intended when embedded. If you're saving charts as static images (e.g., PNGs) for MkDocs, make sure all necessary information is visible without interaction (e.g., clear labels instead of relying solely on tooltips).
* **Responsiveness:** If your audience might view the content on different screen sizes, consider how your visuals will scale or adapt (though this is a more advanced topic).
* **Accessibility:** Consider aspects like color contrast and clear, resizable fonts for broader accessibility (another advanced, but important, topic for future learning).

The primary goal here is to ensure that nothing in the final presentation distracts from or undermines the clarity and credibility of your data story.

???+ activity "**ðŸ’¡ Activity: Your Final Polish Checklist**"

     Before you consider your "mini-story" ready for sharing (even hypothetically), run through this quick final checklist:
    
     1.  **Simplicity:** Is there anything I can remove from my charts to make them simpler without losing information?
     2.  **Consistency:** Are my titles, labels, and color schemes reasonably consistent?
     3.  **Accuracy:** Have I double-checked key numbers and labels in my visuals and text?
     4.  **Proofreading:** Have I read all text for typos or grammatical errors?
     5.  **Flow (for MkDocs):** If I were to put this on a webpage, does the sequence of text and visuals make sense?
    
     Make any quick fixes identified. This is about ensuring a professional finish.
