# Data Aggregation


**Aggregating & Reshaping Data - Summarizing for Insights**

After cleaning and transforming individual data points, the next step is often to aggregate data to extract higher-level insights and summaries. This module covers grouping data and applying aggregation functions, along with a brief introduction to pivoting and window functions.

??? note "Prerequisites"

    ```python
    # Prerequisites: Ensure Polars is imported.
    import polars as pl

    # Re-establishing them here for clarity if this module is run standalone.
    # In a continuous notebook, these would carry over.

    ```

## **1. Group By and Aggregations**

The "group by" operation is a common data manipulation pattern often described as "split-apply-combine":

  * **Split:** The data is divided into groups based on the unique values in one or more specified key columns.
  * **Apply:** An aggregation function (e.g., sum, mean, count) is applied to each group independently.
  * **Combine:** The results of the applications are combined into a new DataFrame.

In Polars, this is primarily achieved using `df.group_by("key_column").agg([...])`.

  * **Creating a `GroupBy` Object:**
    `df.group_by("key_column_name")` or `df.group_by(["col1", "col2"])` creates a `GroupBy` object, which represents the grouped data. No computation happens at this stage.

  * **Applying Aggregations with `.agg()`:**
    The `.agg()` method is called on the `GroupBy` object. It takes a list of Polars expressions that define the aggregations to be performed on each group.

  * **Common Aggregation Expressions:**

      * `pl.sum("col_name")` or `pl.col("col_name").sum()`: Sum of values.
      * `pl.mean("col_name")` or `pl.col("col_name").mean()`: Average of values.
      * `pl.median("col_name")` or `pl.col("col_name").median()`: Median of values.
      * `pl.min("col_name")` or `pl.col("col_name").min()`: Minimum value.
      * `pl.max("col_name")` or `pl.col("col_name").max()`: Maximum value.
      * `pl.count()`: Number of rows in each group. (Note: `pl.col("col_name").count()` counts non-null values in that specific column within the group).
      * `pl.n_unique("col_name")` or `pl.col("col_name").n_unique()`: Number of unique values.
      * `pl.first("col_name")` or `pl.col("col_name").first()`: First value.
      * `pl.last("col_name")` or `pl.col("col_name").last()`: Last value.

  * **Examples:**

    ```python
    # Example 1: Sales summary by product_category from orders_df
    category_summary_df = orders_df.group_by("product_category").agg([
        pl.sum("quantity").alias("total_quantity_sold"),
        pl.mean("unit_price").alias("average_unit_price"),
        pl.col("order_id").count().alias("number_of_orders"), # Counts non-null order_ids per group
        pl.n_unique("customer_id").alias("unique_customers_in_category")
    ]).sort("total_quantity_sold", descending=True)

    print("Sales summary by product category:")
    print(category_summary_df)

    # Example 2: Customer demographics by city from customers_df
    # Using 'age_cleaned' which handles the outlier and converts to Int64 (allowing nulls for mean calculation)
    city_demographics_df = customers_df.group_by("city").agg([
        pl.count().alias("number_of_customers"), # Total customers per city
        pl.mean("age_cleaned").alias("average_age"),
        pl.min("age_cleaned").alias("min_age"),
        pl.max("age_cleaned").alias("max_age")
    ]).sort("number_of_customers", descending=True)

    print("\nCustomer demographics by city:")
    print(city_demographics_df)
    ```

  * **Grouping by Multiple Columns:**
    Pass a list of column names to `group_by()`.

    ```python
    # Example: Total quantity of products sold by each customer for each product category
    customer_category_sales_df = orders_df.group_by(["customer_id", "product_category"]).agg(
        pl.sum("quantity").alias("total_quantity_per_customer_category")
    ).sort(["customer_id", "product_category"])

    print("\nTotal quantity by customer and product category:")
    print(customer_category_sales_df.head(10))
    ```

## **2. Pivoting Data with `df.pivot()`**

Pivoting is a way to reshape data from a "long" format to a "wide" format, where unique values from one column become new column headers.

  * `df.pivot(values="values_col", index="index_col", columns="columns_col", aggregate_function=None)`:

      * `values`: The column whose data will populate the new pivoted columns.
      * `index`: Column(s) that will remain as rows (identifying each row).
      * `columns`: The column whose unique values will become the new column headers.
      * `aggregate_function` (optional): If there are multiple `values` for a given `index` and `column` combination, this function is used to aggregate them (e.g., 'first', 'sum', 'mean'). If not specified or data is already unique for combinations, it takes the first value.

  * **Example:** Create a wide table showing total quantity sold per product category for each year.
    First, ensure we have an 'order\_year' column.

    ```python
    orders_with_year_df = orders_df.with_columns(
        pl.col("order_datetime").dt.year().alias("order_year")
    )

    # Aggregate to get total quantity per year and product category (needed for pivot if not 1-to-1)
    yearly_category_sales = orders_with_year_df.group_by(["order_year", "product_category"]).agg(
        pl.sum("quantity").alias("total_quantity")
    ).sort(["order_year", "product_category"])

    print("\nYearly sales by category (long format):")
    print(yearly_category_sales)

    # Pivot to get product categories as columns
    pivoted_yearly_sales_df = yearly_category_sales.pivot(
        values="total_quantity",
        index="order_year",
        columns="product_category"
    ).fill_null(0) # Fill categories with no sales in a year with 0

    print("\nPivoted yearly sales (product categories as columns):")
    print(pivoted_yearly_sales_df)
    ```

    *Business Context:* This wide format can be useful for reports or visualizations where you want to compare categories side-by-side over years.

## **3. Window Functions**

Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row â€“ this set is called a "window." Unlike `group_by().agg()` operations which typically reduce the number of rows, window functions compute a value for *each* row based on its window.

  * **Concept:** Imagine you want to calculate a running total of sales, or rank products within their categories based on sales quantity, or find the difference between a customer's order amount and the average order amount for their city. These require looking at other rows related to the current one.

  * **Use Cases:** Running totals, moving averages, ranking, calculations relative to a group (e.g., percentage of group total).

  * **Polars Syntax (High-Level):** Window functions are often applied using the `.over("grouping_column_or_expression")` method on an expression.
    For example, `pl.col("sales").sum().over("category")` would compute, for each row, the total sales for that row's category (effectively broadcasting the group sum to each member of the group). `pl.col("sales").rank().over("category")` would rank sales within each category.

    ```python
    # Illustrative example (syntax can be complex for beginners):
    # Calculate running total of quantity per product category over time

    # Ensure data is sorted correctly for a meaningful running total
    orders_sorted_for_window = orders_with_year_df.sort(["product_category", "order_datetime"])

    orders_with_running_total = orders_sorted_for_window.with_columns(
        pl.col("quantity").cumsum().over("product_category").alias("running_total_quantity_in_category")
    )
    print("\nOrders with running total quantity within category (illustrative):")
    print(orders_with_running_total.filter(pl.col("product_category") == "Books").select([
        "order_datetime", "product_category", "quantity", "running_total_quantity_in_category"
    ]))
    ```

    *Note for Students:* Window functions are very powerful but have a steeper learning curve. They are mentioned here for awareness. For many business reporting tasks, standard group-by aggregations are often sufficient.
