Okay, I can generate the content for these two CSV datasets. I'll make them slightly more than 10 rows to give a little more data to play with, while still keeping them small and manageable.

Here's the content for `customers.csv`:

```csv
customer_id,name,registration_date,city,age
101,Alice Wonderland,2022-01-15,New York,28
102,Bob The Builder,2022-03-22,London,35
103,Charlie Brown,2022-05-10,Paris,,45
104,Diana Prince,2022-07-01,New York,3000
105,Evan Almighty,2022-08-19,London,42
106,Fiona Gallagher,2023-01-20,New York,29
107,George Jetson,,Paris,50
108,Hannah Montana,2023-04-05,Berlin,22
109,Ian Malcolm,2023-06-12,London,55
110,Jane Doe,2023-07-21,New York,
111,Kevin McCallister,2023-09-01,Chicago,12
112,Laura Palmer,2023-10-15,Twin Peaks,17
113,Michael Scott,2024-02-10,Scranton,48
114,Nancy Drew,03/15/2024,River Heights,18
115,Oscar Grouch,2024-05-01,New York,60
```

**Explanation of `customers.csv`:**

  * **`customer_id`**: Integer, unique.
  * **`name`**: String.
  * **`registration_date`**: String, with a couple of formats (`YYYY-MM-DD` and `MM/DD/YYYY`) to practice parsing. One missing value.
  * **`city`**: String, with repetitions for `Categorical`/`Enum` practice ("New York", "London", "Paris").
  * **`age`**: Integer, with a couple of missing values. Diana Prince's age is an outlier for potential discussion.

Here's the content for `orders.csv`:

```csv
order_id,customer_id,order_date,product_category,quantity,unit_price,discount_applied

```

**Explanation of `orders.csv`:**

  * **`order_id`**: Integer, unique.
  * **`customer_id`**: Integer, corresponds to `customer_id` in `customers.csv` to allow for joins.
  * **`order_date`**: String, in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format. Could also be simplified to just date if time components aren't needed for initial exercises.
  * **`product_category`**: String, with repetitions ("Books", "Electronics", "Home Goods") and one missing value. Also includes some other categories.
  * **`quantity`**: Small integer. One missing value.
  * **`unit_price`**: Float.
  * **`discount_applied`**: Float (representing a percentage, e.g., 0.05 for 5%). Includes some `0.0` and some missing values (which could mean no discount or data not recorded).

You can copy and paste this content directly into two separate files named `customers.csv` and `orders.csv` respectively. These should provide a good basis for your Polars data wrangling session.
