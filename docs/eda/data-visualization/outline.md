Your ideas for the Altair visualization session are well-aligned with the course's learning objectives and the students' background. The focus on practical skills, API familiarity, and workflow orientation is excellent for graduate business students new to programming.

Here's an evaluation of your broad parameters and some suggestions:

* **Practical Skills**:
    * **End-to-end data storytelling for BI/dashboards and ad-hoc exploration**: Highly relevant. This directly supports creating "actionable insights" and "effective decision-making."
    * **Statistical plots for ML projects**: Good connection to the scikit-learn part of the course. Visualizing data distributions, relationships, and even model performance (though the latter might be a later topic) is key.
    * **Evaluation**: These are strong and address core needs of business analysts.

* **API Familiarity**:
    * **Altair chart objects, encoding channels, selection, and interactivity**: These are the building blocks of Altair and crucial for students to grasp. The course emphasizes understanding library APIs.
    * **Data transformation (Polars) for visualization**: Excellent idea to reinforce Polars skills and show its synergy with Altair. This supports "high-performance data manipulation" leading into visualization.
    * **Evaluation**: Spot on. Understanding the API design is a specific learning objective (LO5.a).

* **Workflow Orientation**:
    * **Encouraging experimentation and incremental development**: Perfect for demystifying visualization and building intuition, which is a course focus.
    * **Evaluating visualization effectiveness**: Essential for business communication and aligns with LO5.d.
    * **Addressing the "knowing what chart to use" misconception**: Important for fostering a problem-solving mindset.
    * **Evaluation**: This pedagogical approach is well-suited for adult learners and beginners, promoting deeper understanding over rote memorization.

**Suggestions and Missing Topics:**

* **Introduce the Grammar of Graphics (Conceptually)**: Briefly explain the core idea (data, marks, encodings) as the foundation of Altair's declarative nature. This will reinforce why Altair is designed the way it is and improve their ability to "interpret the API design choices."
* **Start with "Why Visualize Data?":** Briefly motivate the session by showing examples of how good visualizations lead to insights and poor ones can mislead.
* **Basic Chart Taxonomy**: While encouraging exploration, provide a quick rundown of common chart types (bar, line, scatter, histogram) and their primary uses. This gives a starting point.
* **Customization for Clarity**: Cover essential customizations like titles, axis labels, legends, and basic color adjustments to make charts presentable.
* **Saving and Sharing Visualizations**: A practical skill for students to use their work outside the notebook.
* **Briefly touch on Ethical Considerations**: A quick mention of how visualizations can be misleading would be valuable for business students.

**Topics to Defer or Keep Minimal:**

* **Advanced Interactivity**: Stick to simpler interactivity like tooltips and single selections. Complex linked brushing or custom JavaScript might be too much for an initial session.
* **Deep Statistical Plots**: While statistical plots for ML are good, avoid overly complex statistical theory behind certain plot types unless directly tied to a simple, clear business insight.
* **Geospatial Visualizations**: Unless there's a specific dataset or business case you have in mind that is very simple, this often adds a layer of complexity (data formats, projections) that could be deferred.

**Dataset Choice:**

Using datasets from `altair.vega_datasets` is an excellent choice.
* The **`cars` dataset** is good for scatter plots, exploring relationships, and perhaps simple regression lines.
* The **`movies` dataset** offers opportunities for bar charts (genres, ratings), histograms (budgets, revenue), and scatter plots.
* The **`seattle_weather` dataset** would be very effective for demonstrating line charts and basic time series visualization, aligning with LO4.a ("Describe the unique characteristics and analytical approaches relevant to time series data").
* **Recommendation**: Using **`seattle_weather`** for time-series aspects and either **`cars`** or **`movies`** for general EDA and common chart types would provide good coverage and consistency. Using 1-2 datasets primarily and perhaps a third for a specific exercise is a good balance.

Overall, your ideas are solid. The key will be to structure the lesson logically, starting simple and building complexity, always tying back to how these visualizations help answer business questions or explore data effectively.

## Proposed Lesson Outline: "Visualizing Data with Altair"

This outline incorporates your ideas and the suggestions above, keeping in mind the students' background and the course objectives.

**Overall Goal**: Students should be able to load a dataset (with Polars, which they know), explore it by creating common statistical visualizations with Altair, customize these visualizations for clarity, and understand the basic principles behind Altair's API.

**Assumed Prior Knowledge**:
* Python basics (variables, data types, lists, dictionaries, functions).
* Google Colab proficiency.
* Polars: Reading data, selecting columns, filtering rows, simple aggregations (e.g., `group_by`, `agg`).

**(0. Pre-Session Setup - For Material for MkDocs & Notebook)**
* Brief reminder of Polars for data loading and initial manipulation.
* Installation of Altair (`pip install altair vega_datasets`).

**1. Introduction to Data Visualization with Altair (Approx. 15-20 mins)**
    * **Why Visualize Data?** (Motivation)
        * The power of visual exploration: Anscombe's quartet example (or similar).
        * Role in BI, ad-hoc analysis, and supporting ML.
    * **What is Altair?**
        * Declarative visualization library.
        * Based on the Grammar of Graphics (brief conceptual introduction: data, marks, encodings). This helps with "understanding the choices behind their APIs".
    * **Altair's Core Idea**: `Chart(data).mark_type().encode(channel_mappings)`
    * **Setting up**: Importing Altair.

**2. Your First Plots with Altair (Approx. 30-40 mins)**
    * **Loading Data**: Use a Polars DataFrame (e.g., `cars` or `movies` from `vega_datasets`).
        * Quick reminder: `pl.read_csv()` or loading from `vega_datasets` and converting if necessary (though Altair can often take Polars dfs directly).
    * **Basic Chart Types & Encodings**:
        * **Scatter Plot**: `mark_circle()` or `mark_point()`
            * Encoding: `x`, `y`, `color`, `size`, `tooltip`.
            * *Activity*: Explore relationships between two numerical variables.
        * **Bar Chart**: `mark_bar()`
            * Encoding: `x` (categorical), `y` (quantitative/aggregate), `color`.
            * Using Polars for pre-aggregation if needed (e.g., average rating per genre).
            * *Activity*: Show counts or averages for categories.
        * **Line Chart**: `mark_line()` (using `seattle_weather` dataset)
            * Encoding: `x` (temporal or ordered), `y` (quantitative), `color` (for multiple series).
            * *Activity*: Visualize trends over time.
        * **Histogram**: `mark_bar()` with `alt.X(field, bin=True)`
            * Encoding: `x` (quantitative, binned), `y` (count).
            * *Activity*: Understand the distribution of a single numerical variable.
    * **Workflow Tip**: Start simple, then add encodings incrementally.

**3. Enhancing Your Visualizations (Approx. 25-35 mins)**
    * **Properties**: Adding titles, customizing axis labels (`alt.X('field', title='My X-axis')`), setting width/height.
    * **Color Schemes and Scales**:
        * Briefly on named color schemes.
        * Importance of color for categorical vs. quantitative data.
    * **Tooltips**: Making charts more informative on hover.
    * **Saving Charts**: `chart.save('my_chart.html')` or PNG (mentioning `altair_viewer` or similar for richer exports if time/setup allows, but HTML is fine).
    * **Incremental Development Exercise**: Start with a basic plot and progressively enhance it with labels, titles, and better encodings.

**4. Interactive Visualizations (Approx. 20-30 mins)**
    * **Concept of Selections**: `alt.selection_single()` or `alt.selection_interval()`.
    * **Using Selections**:
        * Conditional encodings (e.g., change color or opacity based on selection).
        * Filtering data in other charts (simple linked views if time allows and can be kept straightforward).
    * **Focus**: Simple, meaningful interactions rather than complex dashboards.
    * *Activity*: Create a scatter plot where clicking a point highlights it, or an interval selection that shows details for selected points.

**5. Data Transformations for Visualization (Briefly with Polars & Altair) (Approx. 15-20 mins)**
    * Recap: Sometimes data isn't in the right "shape" for the desired plot.
    * **Polars for Pre-processing**:
        * Filtering data before plotting.
        * Creating new columns (e.g., for categorizing).
        * Aggregating data (e.g., `group_by().agg()`) for summary charts. Reinforce this as they know Polars.
    * **Altair's Built-in Transformations (Mention, brief example if time permits)**:
        * `calculate` transform (for simple derived fields).
        * `filter` transform.
        * `aggregate` transform.
        * **Key message**: Altair can do some transformations, but complex ones are often best done in Polars beforehand for clarity and performance. This supports LO2.a.

**6. Best Practices & Data Storytelling Workflow (Approx. 15-20 mins)**
    * **Choosing the Right Chart**: Relate back to the data type and the question being asked. (Not a rigid set of rules, but guidelines).
    * **Clarity and Simplicity**: Avoid clutter. Make sure the message is clear.
    * **Iteration and Experimentation**: Reinforce that the first plot is rarely the final one.
    * **Evaluating "Good Enough"**:
        * Does it answer the question?
        * Is it clear and easy to understand for the intended audience?
        * Is it honest (not misleading)?
    * Connecting to the broader data analysis workflow (EDA -> Hypotheses -> Further Analysis / ML). LO5.c.
    * Leveraging documentation and AI tools for help (as mentioned in course description LO5.b).

**(Wrap-up & Next Steps - 5 mins)**
* Recap key Altair concepts.
* Preview how visualization connects to upcoming ML topics.
* Encourage practice with their own datasets or other `vega_datasets`.

This outline provides a structured flow, introduces Altair's capabilities progressively, and ties into the practical application and workflow aspects you highlighted. It also ensures consistent use of datasets.

What are your thoughts on this outline? We can then refine it and move on to discussing the content for MkDocs and the starter notebook.

Okay, great! Anscombe's quartet is indeed a classic and highly effective way to demonstrate the importance of visualization.

Let's refine the outline with that in mind and add a "Things to Try" section.

## Revised Lesson Outline: "Visualizing Data with Altair"

**Overall Goal**: Students should be able to load a dataset (with Polars), explore it by creating common statistical visualizations with Altair, customize these visualizations for clarity, and understand the basic principles behind Altair's API.

**Assumed Prior Knowledge**:

* Python basics (variables, data types, lists, dictionaries, functions).
* Google Colab proficiency.
* Polars: Reading data, selecting columns, filtering rows, simple aggregations (e.g., `group_by`, `agg`).

**(0. Pre-Session Setup - For Material for MkDocs & Notebook)**

* Brief reminder of Polars for data loading and initial manipulation.
* Installation of Altair (`pip install altair vega_datasets`).

**1. Introduction to Data Visualization with Altair (Approx. 20-25 mins)**

* **Why Visualize Data?** (Motivation)
    * **The Power of Visuals**:
        * Start with summary statistics of Anscombe's quartet (show they are nearly identical).
        * Then, reveal the plots of Anscombe's quartet to demonstrate how visuals uncover underlying patterns missed by statistics alone.
        * Briefly discuss how visualization aids in identifying patterns, trends, anomalies, and relationships.
    * Role in Business Intelligence (BI), ad-hoc analysis, and supporting Machine Learning (ML) projects.
* **What is Altair?**
    * A declarative visualization library for Python.
    * Based on the Grammar of Graphics (brief conceptual introduction: data, marks, encodings). This helps with "understanding the choices behind their APIs".
* **Altair's Core Idea**: `Chart(data).mark_type().encode(channel_mappings)`
* **Setting up**: Importing Altair (`import altair as alt`) and enabling the appropriate renderer for Colab.

**2. Your First Plots with Altair (Approx. 35-45 mins)**

* **Loading Data**:
    * Using `vega_datasets` to load a dataset (e.g., `cars` or `movies`).
    * Show how to convert to a Polars DataFrame (e.g., `pl.from_pandas(data.cars())` or if Altair handles it directly, showcase that).
    * *Brief Polars recap*: Show a simple Polars manipulation like `select` or `filter` on the chosen dataset before plotting.
* **Basic Chart Types & Encodings**:
    * **Scatter Plot**: `mark_circle()` or `mark_point()`
        * Encoding: `x`, `y`, `color`, `size`, `tooltip`.
        * *Activity*: Explore relationships between two numerical variables (e.g., 'Horsepower' vs. 'Miles_per_Gallon' from `cars`).
    * **Bar Chart**: `mark_bar()`
        * Encoding: `x` (categorical), `y` (quantitative/aggregate), `color`.
        * Example: Average 'Acceleration' by 'Origin' in the `cars` dataset (might require a simple Polars `group_by().mean()` first, or use Altair's aggregation).
        * *Activity*: Compare counts or averages for different categories.
    * **Line Chart**: `mark_line()` (using `seattle_weather` dataset)
        * Encoding: `x` (temporal or ordered), `y` (quantitative), `color` (for multiple series like 'temp_max' vs 'temp_min').
        * *Activity*: Visualize trends in temperature over a year. This aligns with LO4.a.
    * **Histogram**: `mark_bar()` with `alt.X('field_name:Q', bin=True)` (explicitly show quantitative type hinting `:Q`)
        * Encoding: `x` (quantitative, binned), `y` ('count()').
        * *Activity*: Understand the distribution of 'Displacement' in the `cars` dataset.
* **Workflow Tip**: Start simple (e.g., `alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(x='Horsepower', y='Miles_per_Gallon')`), then incrementally add more encodings (`color`, `size`, `tooltip`).

**3. Enhancing Your Visualizations (Approx. 25-35 mins)**

* **Properties**:
    * Adding titles: `properties(title='My Awesome Chart')`.
    * Customizing axis labels and titles: `alt.X('field', title='My X-axis Label')`, `alt.Y('field', axis=alt.Axis(title='My Y-axis Label', format='~s'))`.
    * Setting width and height: `properties(width=400, height=300)`.
* **Color Schemes and Scales**:
    * Using named color schemes for categorical data: `alt.Color('field:N', scale=alt.Scale(scheme='tableau10'))`. (explicitly show nominal type hinting `:N`)
    * Discussing the importance of appropriate color use.
* **Tooltips**: Making charts more informative on hover: `tooltip=['field1', 'field2']`.
* **Saving Charts**: `chart.save('my_chart.html')` or `chart.save('my_chart.png')` (mentioning potential need for `altair_viewer` or `vl-convert` for PNG/SVG, or stick to what Colab handles easily).
* **Incremental Development Exercise**: Take one of the earlier basic plots and guide students through adding a title, customizing axes, improving color, and refining tooltips for better communication.

**4. Interactive Visualizations (Approx. 20-30 mins)**

* **Concept of Selections**: `alt.selection_single()` (for discrete events like clicks) and `alt.selection_interval()` (for brushing).
* **Using Selections**:
    * **Conditional Encodings**: Change color, size, or opacity based on selection.
        * Example: `color=alt.condition(selection_name, 'highlight_color:N', alt.value('lightgray'))`.
    * **Filtering**: Use a selection to filter data in the same chart or (briefly, if time allows and it can be kept simple) a linked chart.
* **Focus**: Simple, meaningful interactions like highlighting or basic filtering rather than complex dashboards.
* *Activity*: Create a scatter plot where clicking a point highlights it, or an interval selection on a bar chart that might show details or affect another (very simple) linked view.

**5. Data Transformations for Visualization (Approx. 15-20 mins)**

* **Recap**: Data often needs reshaping or summarization for effective visualization.
* **Polars for Pre-processing (Primary Focus)**:
    * Reinforce using Polars for robust data manipulation *before* passing to Altair.
    * Examples:
        * Filtering rows based on conditions.
        * Creating new categorical columns from numerical ones (e.g., 'Weight_Class' from 'Weight_in_lbs').
        * Performing `group_by().agg()` operations for summary plots (e.g., average horsepower per number of cylinders).
* **Altair's Built-in Transformations (Brief Mention & Simple Example)**:
    * `calculate` transform: For deriving new fields directly in Altair (e.g., converting units).
    * `filter` transform: Simple filtering within Altair.
    * `aggregate` and `bin` transforms (already seen in histogram, but can be shown more explicitly).
    * **Key message**: Altair provides convenient transformations for simpler cases, but Polars offers more power and control for complex pre-processing. This reinforces LO2.a and LO5.a.

**6. Best Practices & Data Storytelling Workflow (Approx. 15-20 mins)**

* **Choosing the Right Chart**:
    * Review common chart types (scatter, bar, line, histogram) and when to use them based on data types (nominal, ordinal, quantitative, temporal) and the story you want to tell.
* **Clarity and Simplicity**: "Less is often more." Avoid chart junk. Ensure the message is clear and unambiguous.
* **Audience Awareness**: Tailor complexity and annotations to your audience.
* **Iteration and Experimentation**: Emphasize that visualization is an iterative process. Encourage trying different chart types and encodings.
* **Evaluating "Good Enough" for Presentation**:
    * Does it accurately answer the key question(s)?
    * Is it easily interpretable by the intended audience?
    * Is it honest and not misleading? (Briefly revisit ethics).
* Connecting visualization to the broader data analysis workflow: EDA -> Hypothesis Generation -> Model Building -> Communication.
* **Strategic Use of Resources**: Briefly remind students to use library documentation (Altair's website is excellent) and generative AI tools to help them learn and troubleshoot.

**7. Wrap-up & Next Steps (Approx. 10 mins)**

* **Recap of Key Altair Concepts**:
    * `Chart`, `mark_*`, `encode`.
    * Importance of data shape.
    * Customization and basic interactivity.
* **Connection to Future Topics**: How visualization will be used in upcoming ML sessions (e.g., visualizing distributions of features, residuals of a model, etc.).
* **Things to Try (Independent Learning Activities)**:
    * **Explore a New Dataset**:
        * Pick another dataset from `vega_datasets` (e.g., `iris`, `seattle_temps`, `barley`).
        * Load it using Polars.
        * Try to answer 2-3 questions about the dataset using different Altair charts.
    * **Recreate a Chart**:
        * Find a simple chart online or in a report.
        * Try to recreate it using Altair and one of the available datasets. Focus on matching the chart type and encodings.
    * **Customize Further**:
        * Take one of the charts created during the session.
        * Experiment with different color schemes (see Altair documentation for options).
        * Change font sizes, axis formatting, and legend position.
    * **Interactive Exploration**:
        * Add a different type of selection (e.g., if you used `selection_single`, try `selection_interval`) to a chart.
        * Make the selection control multiple encoding channels (e.g., size and opacity).
    * **Polars + Altair Challenge**:
        * For the `movies` dataset:
            * Use Polars to calculate the average 'IMDB_Rating' and 'Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating' for movies released in each decade.
            * Create an Altair line chart showing these average ratings over the decades (one line for IMDB, one for Rotten Tomatoes).
            * Ensure your chart has a title, clear axis labels, and a legend.
    * **Data Storytelling Snippet**:
        * Choose two related charts you've made.
        * Write a short paragraph (2-3 sentences) explaining the insight these charts provide, as if you were presenting them to a business stakeholder.

This revised outline is more detailed and includes the specific elements you requested. We can now proceed to discuss the content for the Material for MkDocs site and the starter Jupyter Notebook.
